PhD student in the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.

Ever since I realized I am conscious, it has never stopped bothering me why. I try to understand the neuronal processes that underlie conscious perception and their temporal dynamics by employing methods that affect their course and metacognition. I find it intriguing, simply because these processes are the primary basis for emergence of any conscious thought we experience in life.

Research interests:
– the methodology of awareness measurement
– the influence of subliminal visual stimuli on behaviour and metacognition
– transcranial magnetic stimulation in investigation of feed-forward and feedback processes in the visual system
– the methodological aspects of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques
