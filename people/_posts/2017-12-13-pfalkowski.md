MA psychology graduate from Jagiellonian University.

Recently I’m writing in C#.NET a simple environment for AI experiments related (but not restricted) to consciousness. I believe modeling (thus understanding) self-organizing, associative memory is crucial in understanding the notion of meaning, which I’m primarily interested in.

Research interests:
- modelling representation in machine using self organizing maps and learning vector quantisation
- stock market prices prediction using learning vector quantization variants
- artificial grammars classification by neural networks
