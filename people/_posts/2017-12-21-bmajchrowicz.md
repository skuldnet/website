PhD student at the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.

In my work I focus on intentionality and sense of agency research in health and disease. I am investigating what mechanisms undeprin action awareness, as well as what is the relation between different types of agency measures, such as temporal binding, sensory attenuation, and declarative judgements.

Research interests:
– sense of agency
– perception in action
– bodily awareness cognition in schizophrenia and psychosis
– enactive and phenomenological approaches
– philosophy of psychology and mind
