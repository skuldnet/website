PhD student in the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.

My research concentrates on the influence of selective attention on the quality and subjective accessibility of short-term memory and working memory. 

Research interests:
- the retro-cue benefit
- relationship between memory & consciousness
- bayesian approach to data analysis
- open science
