Doctor of Social Sciences, graduated in the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.

My research concerns perception of own body location in space. In order to investigate the problem of embodiment I use distal-to-tactile sensory substitution device (Enactive Torch), rubber-hand illusion paradigm and virtual roller coaster simulations.

Research interests:
– embodiment
– spatial navigation
– sensory substitution
– virtual reality
