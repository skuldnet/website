Assistant Professor at the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University. Co-funder of C-Lab.

My main scientific interest is the scientific study of consciousness. I have done research on the temporal aspects of consciousness, in particular the neural mechanisms underlying the perception of subjective ‘now’ – a necessary part of any conscious experience. My second field of study is the diagnosis of consciousness in severe brain damage.

Research interests:
– temporal perception
– consciousness
– EEG
– fMRI
