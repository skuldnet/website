PhD student at the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.

I am interested in scientific study of consciousness, its relation to attention and working memory and neural underpinnings of these processes.

Research interests:
– visual awareness
– relationship between attention and consciousness
– relationship between working memory and consciousness
– left hemisphere interpreter
– binocular rivalry
