Psychology student at the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.
Diamond Grant recipient.

My master thesis research focuses on how multisensory integration in peripersonal space shapes our sense of self-location and body ownership, how we can manipulate these mechanisms experimentally to trigger interesting bodily illusions (e.g. heautoscopy, out of body experience, supernumerary arm illusion, magnetic touch illusion) and explore the plasticity of body representation.

I am mostly interested in extrapolations of Integrated Information Theory. In my future research I would like to verify some of its predictions and use it as a framework to investigate various qualitatively altered states of consciousness, such as psychosis, meditative states, synaesthetic experiences.

Research interests:
– integrated information theory
– circuit dynamics and cognition
– bodily self
– spatial awareness
– altered states of consciousness
– invariance in object recognition
– philosophy of information and causality
