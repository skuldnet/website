					<h2><strong>C-LAB</strong> was founded in 2009
					<br />
					by scientists working at the Institute of Psychology.</h2>
					<p>We are all fascinated by the phenomenon of <strong>Consciousness</strong> and its role in human behavior.
					<br />
					We investigate a wide range of problems, including the relations between attention and consciousness,
					<br />
					temporal perception, subjective measures of consciousness and implicit learning.</p>

									<h2>It is all about <strong>the research</strong>.</h2>
								</header>
								<p>In their work, our lab members focus on different aspects of human conscious functioning, from perception,
									through attention, memory, decision making, up to the concept of self.
									<br />
									To do that properly, we use a variety of paradigms and measures including behavioral tasks, EEG measurement,
									fMRI, heart-rate variability, sensory substitution or binocular rivalry.
